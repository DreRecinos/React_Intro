Why does React only allow information to be passed down in the hierarchy? What are the advantages and disadvantages of this approach? Discuss this topic with your mentor.


React only allows information to be passes down in hierarchy because it uses unidirectional data flow, which allows us to have a clean, single-truth data flow. Our data flows down from the parent components to the child components and can continue to flow throughout the child and eventually flow down to their child components. Some advantages to this approach is that we are always able to see where our bugs occur because they occur in a single point. Also it makes understanding someone else's code easier, as it is cleaner and you can see how your code moves with a bit more clarity. A disadvantage of uni-directional data flow are you can't have a affect over the parent component as child components.
